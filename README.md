Data source : Udemy courses data : https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedashfaq6777/udemy-courses-dataset

This data set includes information about the different courses with price etc available on Udemy.
Data structure: This csv file include 3682 rows and 11 coloumns.

In my opinion the following questions are the most important question in the data set.
1. What are all different subjects for which Udemy is offering courses ?
2. Which subject has the maximum number of courses.
3. Show all the courses which are Free of Cost.
4. Show all the courses which are Paid.
5. Which are Top Selling Courses ?
6 Which are Least Selling Courses ?

10. What is the Max. Number of Subscribers for Each Level of courses?
